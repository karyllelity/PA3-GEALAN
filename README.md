# PA2-GEALAN

The purpose of this task is to load datasets and apply skills in manipulating specific data from the DataFrame using pandas subsetting, slicing, and indexing operations.

## Description

1. Using knowledge obtained from the experiment and demonstrations:
   Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas.
   Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars.
2. Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing, and indexing operations.
   Display the first five rows with odd numbered columns of cars
   Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’
   How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?
   Determine how maby cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.
